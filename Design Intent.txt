Design Goal
  The goal of this project is to build a lightweight screen saver in circuitpython for use on an rp2040 macropad.
Design Intent
  Four lines will scan across the screen, varying their stopping position randomly.
  The rectangle formed at the intersection of the four lines will blink red a random number of times.
  The display will be blanked, and the lines will be redrawn, until the process is interrupted.
